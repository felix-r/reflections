How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The diff function helped to locate where changes were made.
With that it is easier to find error sources in comparison
to the previous fully functioning code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I could have access to a version of the that is still working properly
ans thus see, were errors were introduced into new code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

+ can choose when a change is meaningful
- may forget to commit after crucial change of code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git was made for coding, where it is usual that files are interconnected
Google Docs wasn't released with the intention to compare beteween interconnected files
Google Docs only saves backups of each file  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log:
See when and who changed which files where changes, and how change was described by user

git diff:
see which lines in code of two commits were changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

With git checkout I can symply go back to a version where the program was working properly
and see what changes were made since then

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

No clue yet
This course is kinda annoying
