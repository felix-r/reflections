When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I want to use different Computers to work on the same project I could push changes to github
on the first machine and then pull them on the other and keep making changes there ...
Also if several people work on the same project you can use github to push your changes there
and make them visible for other users/developers
