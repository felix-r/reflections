What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When initializing a repository git is able to track files in it.
A repsoitory contains the files you wanna make commits to, 
to later be able to track these.
You need it, so that git knows where to apply commits to 
and which files should be tracked for a specific project.
