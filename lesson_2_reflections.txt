What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When initializing a repository git is able to track files in it.
A repsoitory contains the files you wanna make commits to, 
to later be able to track these.
You need it, so that git knows where to apply commits to 
and which files should be tracked for a specific project. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a virtual environment in git where you can add changes before 
comitting them to the repository.
With that it is able to change several programs at once, 
but make single commits per program change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Add the files that you want to commit to staging area. Then commit.
Repeat for new other changes that you want to have in a different commit
